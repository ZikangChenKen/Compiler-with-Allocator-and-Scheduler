// COMP 412, Lab 1, block "report7.i"
//
// This report block was submitted as a 
// Lab 3 test block by Yi Dai in Fall 2014.
//
//
// This block tests the intertwined memory operations that do or do not use/refer to the
// same memory addresses. It also includes almost all important possible orderings among
// load, store and output to test on. This is especially helpful when the
// dependency graph has been simplified, user can test to see if the necessary edges are
// there or if there are unnecessary edges.
